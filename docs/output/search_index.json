Each hyperspectral cube exhibits differing structural and probabilistic characteristics, as outlined below. They are made available as binary .rds files for R. "],
["shgr-class-maps.html", "Chapter 1 SHGR Class Maps", " Chapter 1 SHGR Class Maps The synthetic spectra of each pixel of each cube were sampled from a Gaussian mixture distribution with either 8, 11, or 20 components (known as “8class”, “11class” and “20class”, respectively, from here on). By convention, each mixture component is labeled A - H (8class), A - K (11class) or A - T (20class). The samples from each class are arranged spatially within in a \\(128 \\times 128\\) pixel (so, \\(N = 16,384\\)) image cube according to the class maps below, which were recyled from previous 6-dimensional hyperspectral cubes [1].

["class-means.html", "Chapter 2 Class Means", " Chapter 2 Class Means The class-wise mean intensities were derived from Gaussian Random Walks (bounded within the range [5, 995]) across the synthetic spectral channels (which serve the role of time in a standard random walk). The starting point of each mean walk was sampled uniformly from [50, 950]. The change at each step was sampled \\(N(\\mu,5)\\), where \\(\\mu\\) was sampled uniformly from \\({−8, −4, 0, 4, 8}\\). At any point where the random walk hit (surpassed) the above boundaries, a new \\(\\mu\\) with opposite sign was selected (uniformly, from the same set). Random change points were also selected where the mean trend was reversed in the same manner. To produce mean spectral intensities with more salient structure a LOWESS smoother [2] was applied across the dimensions (channels) to even out the mean walk trajectories. References "],
["class-covariance-structures.html", "Chapter 3 Class Covariance Structures", " Chapter 3 Class Covariance Structures SHGR data was generated both with and without component-wise correlation. The correlation structures, when applied, were also randomly sampled from [0.4, 0.9] and structured according to the Toeplitz model of [3]. Mixtures with a component-wise correlation structure are denoted by “SHGR-cov”, whereas mixtures with spherical component densities are denoted by “SHGR-var”.Two variance levels have been added to each of the component-wise correlation matrices introduced above. We define “Low Noise” cases as those with components whose dimension-wise variances were sampled uniformly from [100 − 500] and “High Noise” cases with variances sampled from [500 − 4000].
